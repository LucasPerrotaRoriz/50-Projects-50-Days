# My Awesome Project
Holux is a retail website that presents luxury houses. It makes use of responsive design to make it available for all devices, as well as a modern design. 

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript


## Optimizations

In the future i will redo these projects in other technologies and add some new features to them.

## Lessons Learned from course:

* Practiced frontend skills with HTML/CSS
* Practiced Javascript skills in mini projects that can be used on real projects
